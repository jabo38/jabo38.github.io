    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Many timestamping services exist in one form or another in the blockchain sphere, but most of these are simple first generation systems for hashing a document to get its fingerprint and then timestamping that fingerprint in the blockchain with a transaction. These are one-off fixed transactions that have their reason to be culminating in being included in a block so that later they may be audited. These 1.0 timestamps are not updatable, cannot be transferred from one owner to another, and cannot have additional value and assets attached to the timestamp. Apostille, as the first 2.0 blockchain notarization service, solves these problems and offers a new set of features and business opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>The Apostille system's key innovation is taking data which represents an underlying person, place, or thing and giving that data its own private key derived deterministically from its contents. This is used to create an account that represents the state of that object. These are dynamic accounts that can be used to prove authenticity, show ownership, and record updates, as well as be branded, transferable and conjointly owned.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The idea of timestamping documents to prove they existed and were in one's possession has been around since long before the blockchain, but with the invention of Bitcoin, many have seen the blockchain as a natural fit for this service taking advantage of the blockchain's usefulness as an open and auditable timestamped ledger.</p>
    
    <p>Timestamping the hashed fingerprint of a document into the blockchain has come to be known as proof-of-existence (PoE). One of the first and most recognized services is <a href="https://proofofexistence.com/">proofofexistence.com</a>, which is an open source website started in 2012. Users can drag and drop their document and get a hash representing the document's digital fingerprint that can then be stamped in the Bitcoin blockchain. Since PoE's start many other services have arisen, some with small improvements or cheaper fees have emerged, but these more or less rely on the same formula. These are one-time timestamping processes where a person uploads a document and stamps it in a blockchain. That is the limit of their utility.</p>
    
    <h2>2. NEM Features</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Namespaces</h3>
    <p>Namespaces on the NEM system is a domain naming system, but one both like and unlike that of the internet. There are unique root-level domains and non-unique subdomains, typically used to classify fully qualified unique assets or naming systems.</p>
    
    <h3>2.2. Mosaics - Assets on the NEM Blockchain</h3>
    <p>Mosaics in NEM are essentially named assets inherent in the NEM blockchain, and not on a 2nd party layer. They can represent any kind of asset that a company, such as "foo company", would like to issue.</p>
    
    <h3>2.3. Messages</h3>
    <p>Messages in NEM come in three flavors: open, encrypted, and hex. They can be of any length up to 320 characters (272 encrypted), and messages can be strung together if needed.</p>
    
    <h3>2.4. Multisig Contracts</h3>
    <p>Multisignature and multiuser accounts play an important and critical role in the Apostille system. Although other blockchain's multisignature solutions resemble NEM's multisignature accounts on the surface, there are subtle differences that set NEM apart.</p>
    
    <h2>3. The Apostille System</h2>
    <p>Apostille takes advantage of many different features to make a holistic blockchain notarization system, one in which notarizations are not static one-time timestamps, but instead can now be dynamic, moving, changing, and updatable values on the blockchain.</p>
    
    <img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="Overview of the Apostille system framework and Apostille account creation">
    
    <h3>3.1. Preparing the Initiating Blockchain Notarization Account</h3>
    <p>While any account can initiate a blockchain notarization, it is preferably one that has a namespace and has published that namespace in their company information profile within their website, brochure, package information, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2. Types of Apostille Notarizations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Sync:</strong> Plain hashes are sent to a public synk address.</li>
        <li><strong>Private, Transferable and Updatable:</strong> Hashes are signed using the owner's private key and sent to a colored HD account (Apostille account) created from a file's dedicated private key.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.3. Making a File's Dedicated Private Key - Coloring HD Accounts - Creating an Apostille Account</h3>
    <p>A hierarchical deterministic (HD) account is generated from the file name, which is hashed using SHA-256 and then signed with user's private key.</p>
    
    <h3>3.4. Apostille Hashes - Preparing the Timestamp Fingerprint - Making the Blockchain Notarization</h3>
    <p>An Apostille transaction message is the hash of the file data (document fingerprint) prepended with a custom Apostille hash header that begins with 4 byte magic bytes.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Uses Cases</h2>
    <h3>4.1.1. Car Title</h3>
    <p>A car that has had its certificate of ownership notarized on the blockchain can have messages sent to its colored HD account reflecting what repairs and maintenance had been done and at what mileage.</p>
    
    <h3>4.1.2. Government Registration</h3>
    <p>A government could send a mosaic or message to the colored blockchain notarization HD account showing the car has been registered and taxes paid.</p>
    
    <h3>4.1.3. Digital Media Licenses</h3>
    <p>A digital media blockchain license can have messages sent to it representing how many times a product has been streamed.</p>
    
    <h3>4.1.4. Luxury Consumer Goods and Anti-Counterfeiting</h3>
    <p>Companies with luxury goods can make a namespace account that only they can control. They can publish this name on their company profile.</p>
    
    <h3>4.1.5. Two-Party Legal Contracts</h3>
    <p>The Apostille system is an ideal candidate for making on-chain notarizations of contracts signed by multiple parties which can then later be updated or transferred if desired.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This paper has proposed a blockchain powered account certification and notarization solution made possible on the NEM block chain platform. We believe the Apostille service is a unique and a notable improvement in blockchain technology.</p>
    
    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>The Apostille project was financially supported by the NEM Community Fund. We would like to thank all the NEM community members that took time to show support for this project.</p>
